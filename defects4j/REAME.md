THis folder contains the sketch4j evaluation dataset for defects4j. 

To ease the cross-validation, we include the source file under synthesis and test drivers that cover only the failing tests. 

All projects have been tested under Java 1.8.

All projects should have no problem to run on Java 1.7 except some Closure projects, e.g., Closure 101 seems not support 1.7 due its use of some native calls.
